# Programming Rust

## Chapter 2 : A Tour of Rust
Rust is an amazing systems level language that considers type safety as a primary factor. Thus, it is a fast and gorgeous language that cares a lot about memory safety, error handling and type systems. Chapter 2 is a basic introduction to Rust, where I implemented basic functions to realize the notion of this language. Inside the `mandelbrot` project, the Mandelbrot set is evaluated and visualized in a concurrent way using 8 threads. It is very efficient and easy to write a multi-threaded code in Rust.

## Chapter 3 : Basic Types
Inside Rust, there are very many internal types designed by the Type Class method. This allows even primitive types to have methods of their own, which is a charming feature of this language. We examine multiple types and useful built-in methods for each types. Finally, we appreciate the thorough type infer system of rust, where all the types are statically analyzed before compiling. This makes rust a very easy language to use, and there are as less bugs that may occur in compile time than any other language.
