# Programming Rust

## Chapter 2
Rust is an amazing systems level language that considers type safety as a primary factor. Thus, it is a fast and gorgeous language that cares a lot about memory safety, error handling and type systems. Chapter 2 is a basic introduction to Rust, where I implemented basic functions to realize the notion of this language. Inside the `mandelbrot` project, the Mandelbrot set is evaluated and visualized in a concurrent way using 8 threads. It is very efficient and easy to write a multi-threaded code in Rust.
